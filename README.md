* Odoo Hiring Take Home Assignment
  * Problem Statement
    * We want to allow multiple product image uploads in the inventory module. ![Screenshot of Single Product Update](screenshot.png "Screenshot")
    * In default case, you can add only a single image for a product. We want it to extend and make it select multiple images and first should become the default image for thumbnail.
    * When you click on the default image thumbnail then it should open a carousel to see all images.
    * In case of edit it should allow us to select the number of images which will be configured from settings.
    * Bonus to do: Add zoom for product thumbnail in listing, kanban and single product view.
